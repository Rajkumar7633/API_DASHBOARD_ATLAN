# API Dashboard ATLAN

## Description

This project is an API dashboard built to visualize and manage data. It consists of a backend server built with Node.js and a frontend interface.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the server directory:

    ```
    cd server
    ```

2.  Install the necessary Node.js packages:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the backend server:

    ```
    node index.js
    ```

    The server should now be running.

### Frontend

1.  Open a new terminal.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
3.  Install the necessary npm packages:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4.  Run the frontend development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the frontend development server, and the dashboard should be accessible in your browser.

## Usage

*   **Backend**: The backend server provides the API endpoints for the dashboard.
*   **Frontend**: The frontend consumes the API endpoints from the backend to display and manage data. Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.

## Additional Information

Make sure your frontend is configured to connect to the correct backend API endpoint. The frontend is set up to access data from the server, so ensure both the frontend and backend are running concurrently.
