# API Monitoring Dashboard: Design & Implementation

## Project Overview

The **API Monitoring Dashboard** is a comprehensive solution designed to provide real-time monitoring and observability for APIs, databases, and services. It leverages a hybrid architecture combining client-side rendering (Next.js) with server-side data collection (Express.js). The dashboard offers insights into system performance, errors, and service health, enabling teams to detect and resolve issues proactively.

## Major Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### **Architecture Approach**

1. **Real-time Monitoring with Fallback**:  
   The dashboard uses real-time data from the server but falls back to mock data when the server is unavailable, ensuring continuous visibility during outages.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:  
   The architecture separates the presentation layer (Next.js frontend) from the data collection layer (Express.js backend), allowing independent scalability.

3. **Modular Monitoring Components**:  
   The backend includes distinct modules for:
   - API monitoring
   - Database monitoring
   - Service health checks
   - Alerting mechanisms  
   This modularity ensures extensibility and maintainability.

4. **Stateless Design**:  
   The dashboard retrieves metrics on demand rather than maintaining complex client-side states, simplifying implementation and reducing bugs.

### **Key Tradeoffs**

1. **In-Memory vs. Persistent Storage**:  
   Metrics are stored in memory for fast access but limit historical data retention. This prioritizes performance over long-term analysis.

2. **Comprehensive vs. Focused Monitoring**:  
   The dashboard provides a holistic view of APIs, databases, and services rather than specializing in one area, trading depth for breadth.

3. **Real-time Updates vs. Network Efficiency**:  
   Frequent polling ensures near-real-time updates but increases network traffic.

4. **Simplicity vs. Advanced Features**:  
   The focus is on core monitoring capabilities rather than advanced features like anomaly detection or predictive analytics.

## Proof of Solution

The API Monitoring Dashboard addresses modern observability needs with the following features:

1. **Comprehensive Visibility**:  
   Unified insights into API performance, errors, system resources, and service health.

2. **Real-time Monitoring**:  
   Near-real-time metrics capture and display for immediate issue detection.

3. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**:  
   Analyze metrics across endpoints, time ranges, and error types to identify patterns and correlations.

4. **Alerting Capabilities**:  
   Threshold-based alerts notify teams of potential issues before they escalate.

5. **Adaptability**:  
   Modular design supports monitoring diverse APIs and services without code changes.

---

## Known Gaps and Limitations

1. **Limited Historical Analysis**:  
   Focuses on recent metrics rather than long-term trends, suitable for operational monitoring.

2. **Basic Alerting Logic**:  
   Uses simple threshold-based rules instead of complex anomaly detection.

3. **No Distributed Tracing Integration**:  
   While trace IDs are captured, full tracing visualization is not implemented.

4. **Limited Customization**:  
   Fixed visualizations simplify implementation but lack user-defined customization options.

5. **No User Management**:  
   Lacks role-based access control; suitable for internal team use only.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
    ```
    cd server
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:
    ```
    node index.js
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

---

## Usage

- Ensure both the backend (`server`) and frontend are running concurrently.
- Access the dashboard in your browser to monitor APIs, databases, and services in real-time.
- Alerts will notify you of any threshold violations or service disruptions.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. Add persistent storage for historical data analysis.
2. Implement advanced alerting with anomaly detection.
3. Enable distributed tracing visualization.
4. Introduce customizable dashboards for user-defined metrics.
5. Add user management with role-based access control for multi-team environments.
